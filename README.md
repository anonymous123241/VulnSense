# VulnSense

In this repository, we present 12 images showcasing instances of various vulnerability types. These images have been divided into two categories: the 'seen classes' and the 'unseen classes', based on their time of discovery.

Seen Classes:
The first six images represent instances from seen classes. These have been randomly selected, encompassing two instances from each of three different vulnerability types that were discovered before 2021. It is assumed that these types are familiar or 'seen' as GPT-4.0 had been trained on extensive data up to that period.

Unseen Classes:
The latter six images signify instances from unseen classes. For these, we've sampled two instances from each of three vulnerability types discovered post-2021.

Image Naming Convention:
Each image is labeled as: "Label # - Predicted type by GPT-4.0". This helps in easy identification and understanding of the vulnerability type that GPT-4.0 predicted for the given instance.
